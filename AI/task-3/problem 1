WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING: 
it is a science of programming computer so that they can learn from data.
Ordinary System + With Application of AI -----> Machine learning.
TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING:
I.SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING:
In supervised learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels.
Applications:
1.Spam filter
2.Object recognition
3.Bioinfomatics
4.Fraud detection in banking etc.
II.UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING:
In unsupervised learning, as you might guess, the training data is unlabeled. The system tries to learn without a teacher.
Applications:
1.Clustring 
2.Anomoly detection
3.Association mining 
4.Latent variable model etc..
III.SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING:
Semi-supervised learning is a mix between supervised and unsupervised approaches.
It uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, 
which provides the benefits of both unsupervised and supervised learning while avoiding the challenges of finding a large amount of labeled data.
That means you can train a model to label data without having to use as much labeled training data. 
Applications:
1.Text document classifier
2.Image and speech analysis
3.Banking etc..
IV.REINFORCEMENT MACHINE LEARNING:
Reinforcement Learning means reinforcing or training the existing ML models so that they may produce well a sequence of decisions.
Applications:
1.Manufacturing
2.Image processing 
3.Gaming
4.Robotics
5.Healthcare 
6.Broadcast journalism 
7.Marketing
